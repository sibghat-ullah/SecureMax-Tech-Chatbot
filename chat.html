      9. IT Security
      To avoid potential threats to your IT systems & database, our experts present a foolproof strategy for the security & protection of integrated systems from external attacks.

      Threats to data security and company information are increasing daily. It‚Äôs necessary to prevent external attacks from the Internet at many different levels. It‚Äôs also wise to protect information internally from prying eyes, and even malicious damage. In addition, contingency plans ought to be in place. These can literally save the business should a catastrophic event occur. Security equipment has advanced to cope with modern threats, but that inevitably means it become ever more complex. Without specialist knowledge, some of the tools available can be far more of an obstacle to users than a benefit.

      Secure communications are possible, however (thanks to the Internet), over long distances, and cost effective too. It is possible to keep business data and communications safe and without undue restrictions on collaborative business activities. Secure Max have a great deal of experience in installing and managing security devices such as firewalls, access control devices such as key based authentication systems, as well as onsite and offsite backup and data protection systems. We are familiar with modern integrated facilities management systems too, and have design-level expertise in remote monitoring approaches. We use to ensure our clients are fully protected from external or internal threats to data security.

      Network security
      Network security is any activity designed to protect the usability and integrity of your network and data. It includes both hardware and software technologies. Effective network security manages access to the network. It targets a variety of threats and stops them from entering or spreading on your network. Network security is an integration of multiple layers of defenses in the network and at the network. Policies and controls are implemented by each network security layer.

      it-security

      Access to networks is gained by authorized users, whereas, malicious actors are indeed blocked from executing threats and exploits. Our world has presently been transformed by digitization, resulting in changes in almost all our daily activities. It is essential for all organizations to protect their networks if they aim at delivering the services demanded by employees and customers.

      This eventually protects the reputation of your organization. With hackers increasing and becoming smarter day by day, the need to utilize network security tool becomes more and more impotent

      Gateway security
      A secure Web gateway is primarily used to monitor and prevent malicious traffic and data from entering, or even leaving, an organization‚Äôs network. Typically, it is implemented to secure an organization against threats originating from the Internet, websites and other Web 2.0 products services. It is generally implemented through a hardware/software gateway device application implemented at the outer boundaries of a network. Some of the features a secure Web gateway provides include URL filtering, application-level control, data leakage prevention, and virus/malware code detection.

      Application security
      Application security is the use of software, hardware, and procedural methods to protect applications from external threats.Once an afterthought in software design, security is becoming an increasingly important concern during development as applications become more frequently accessible over networks and are, as a result, vulnerable to a wide variety of threats. Security measures built into applications and a sound application security routine minimize the likelihood that unauthorized code will be able to manipulate applications to access, steal, modify, or delete sensitive data. Actions taken to ensure application security are sometimes called countermeasures. The most basic software countermeasure is an application firewall that limits the execution of files or the handling of data by specific installed programs. The most common hardware countermeasure is a router that can prevent the IP address of an individual computer from being directly visible on the Internet. Other countermeasures include conventional firewalls, encryption/decryption programs, anti-virus programs, spyware detection/removal programs and biometric authentication systems.

      Endpoint security
      Endpoint security is designed to secure each endpoint on the network created by these devices like remote devices such as laptops or other wireless and mobile devices.Usually, endpoint security is a security system that consists of security software, located on a centrally managed and accessible server or gateway within the network, in addition to client software is installed on each of the endpoints (or devices). The server authenticates logins from the endpoints and also updates the device software when needed. While endpoint security software differs by a vendor, you can expect most software offerings to provide antivirus, antispyware, firewall and also a host intrusion prevention system (HIPS).

      17. Consultant:

      Secure Max consultants work to stop their clients‚Äô information from getting out and viruses, spyware, and cyber hackers from getting into their networks. Many businesses, as well as government organizations, have large banks of confidential information stored on their networks.

      This information includes financial reports, project details, customer contact information, and other valuable data that the organization would not want to be accessed by those without proper permission.

      Consultants work on setting up firewalls, passwords, specialized security software and other methods of preventing unwanted intrusions into the network.

      They must keep up with new technical developments to ensure that databases are constantly updated against hacks. Consultants often also educate users on network safety to further reduce the chances of a security breach.

      18. Cyber Security

      Our cybersecurity feature designed to defend computer systems, software, networks and user data from unauthorized access; also from threats distributed through the Internet by cybercriminals, terrorist groups, and hackers. Cybersecurity is all about protecting your devices and network from unauthorized access or modification.

      It Can Protect Your Business
      The biggest advantage is that the best in IT security cybersecurity solutions can provide comprehensive digital protection to your business. This will allow your employees to surf the internet as and when they need, and ensure that they aren‚Äôt at risk from potential threats.

      Protects Personal Info
      One of the most valuable commodities in the digital age is personal information. If a virus is able to obtain personal information regarding your employees or customers, they are quite capable of selling that information on or even using it to steal their money.

      Allows Employees to Work Safely
      Without the best cybersecurity solutions for your business, you and your employees are constantly at risk from a potential cyber-attack. If your system, or even individual computers, become infected than that can really hamper their productivity and even force you to replace computers.

      Protects Productivity
      Viruses can slow down personal computers to a crawl, and make working on them practically impossible. This can cause a lot of wasted time for your employees, and can often bring your entire business to a standstill.

      Stop Your Website from Going Down
      As a business, the chances are you‚Äôre hosting your own website. If your system becomes infected, there is a very real chance that your website is forced to shut down. This means that not only will you be losing money from missed transactions, but you will also lose customer trust and certain viruses can often do lasting damage to a system.

      Prevents Adware
      Adware is a form of computer virus which fills your computer with advertisements and is fairly common. However, all these adverts can really have an impact on productivity and can often allow other viruses to enter your computer once you‚Äôve accidentally clicked on them.

      Network switching
      In a network, a switch is a device that channels incoming data from any of multiple in a network, a switch is a device that channels incoming data from any of multiple input ports to the specific output port that will take it toward its intended destination.

      In a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet, a network switch determines where to send each incoming message frame by looking at the physical device address (also known as the Media Access Control address or MAC address). Switches maintain tables that match each MAC address to the port from which the MAC address has been received.

      If a frame is to be forwarded to a MAC address that is unknown to the switch infrastructure, it is flooded to all ports in the switching domain. Broadcast and multicast frames are also flooded.

      This is known as BUM flooding, broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast flooding. This capability makes a switch a Layer 2 or data-link layer device in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communications model.

      Routing
      Routing is used to tie multiple networks together. For example, you would use a router to connect your networked computers to the Internet and thereby share an Internet connection among many users. The router will act as a dispatcher, choosing the best route for your information to travel so that you receive it quickly. Routers analyze the data being sent over a network, change how it is packaged and send it to another network or over a different type of network.

      They connect your business to the outside world, protect your information from security threats, and can even decide which computers get priority over others. Depending on your business and your networking plans, you can choose from routers that include different capabilities.

      These can include functions such as:
      Firewall: specialized software that examines incoming data and protects your business network against attacks
      Virtual Private Network (VPN): A way to allow remote employees to safely access your network remotely
      IP Phone network: Combine your company's computer and a telephone network, using voice and conferencing technology, to simplify and unify your communications.
